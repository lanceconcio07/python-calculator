# Python Calculator Project

A simple calculator web application built with Python Flask and JavaScript.

## Description
This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and includes special functions like power and factorial calculations.

## Python Keywords Used in the Project
The following Python keywords are demonstrated in this project:

1. **Flow Control Keywords:**
   - `if`: Used for conditional execution
   - `elif`: Used for additional conditions
   - `else`: Used for alternative execution
   - `for`: Used for iteration over sequences
   - `while`: Used for conditional loops
   - `break`: Used to exit loops
   - `continue`: Used to skip loop iterations
   - `pass`: Used as a placeholder

2. **Exception Handling:**
   - `try`: Begins a block of code that might raise exceptions
   - `except`: Handles exceptions
   - `finally`: Executes cleanup code
   - `raise`: Triggers exceptions manually
   - `assert`: Verifies conditions

3. **Function and Class Definition:**
   - `def`: Defines functions and methods
   - `class`: Creates class definitions
   - `return`: Returns values from functions
   - `lambda`: Creates anonymous functions

4. **Module and Package Management:**
   - `import`: Includes external modules
   - `from`: Imports specific items from modules
   - `as`: Creates aliases for imports

5. **Variable Scope:**
   - `global`: Declares global variables
   - `nonlocal`: References variables in outer scope

6. **Context Management:**
   - `with`: Manages resource handling
   - `yield`: Creates generator functions

7. **Boolean Operations:**
   - `and`: Logical AND operator
   - `or`: Logical OR operator
   - `not`: Logical NOT operator
   - `True`: Boolean true value
   - `False`: Boolean false value
   - `None`: Represents null/absence of value
